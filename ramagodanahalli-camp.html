    <article class="container blog-content">
        <img src="static/ramagodanahalli-camp.jpg"
            alt="CareForAll volunteers and doctors at Ramagodanahalli Government School">

        <p class="lead">On the 3rd of January 2026, CareForAll collaborated with Ramagodanahalli Government School and
            organised a comprehensive medical camp for students between classes 6 and 8 across both English and Kannada
            medium sections. The camp was held on the school premises and reached nearly 220 students and was supported
            by 14 student volunteers and a team of paediatric specialists from Narayana Health. It was focused at
            identifying common yet often overlooked health concerns at an early stage, and the initiative brought
            preventive healthcare where access was simple and participation was natural.</p>

        <p>CareForAll aims to bridge these gaps in healthcare access by bringing important services directly to
            communities that don't have access to them. Government schools often take care of kids who don't get regular
            medical care, making these early screenings essential. The purpose of this camp was to identify basic health
            problems, raise awareness, and make sure that kids got the right help before their budding concerns
            developed into long term challenges.</p>

        <h2>A Structured Approach to Screening</h2>
        <p>The camp followed a structured, station-based process to ensure efficiency and accuracy. Volunteers were
            paired and managed different health stations where students underwent basic screenings, including eye power
            checks, temperature readings, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), pulse monitoring, and measurements of height and
            weight. At each station, volunteers carefully recorded vitals on individual prescription sheets carried by
            each child, ensuring continuity as students moved through the process.</p>

        <p>Once all the screenings were completed, the students met with doctors for one-on-one consultations. A team of
            five paediatricians from Narayana Health—four junior doctors and one senior consultant specialising in
            paediatric nephrology—reviewed each child's recorded data before conducting detailed assessments, allowing
            for focused diagnosis and guidance.</p>

        <h2>Identifying Common Health Patterns</h2>
        <p>The camp's size made it possible to identify common health patterns. In addition to growth-related concerns,
            vision issues, and dental caries, a number of children were discovered to have iron and vitamin D
            deficiencies. Even though many of these disorders are treatable, they can have a substantial impact on
            learning, energy levels, and general physical development if left undiagnosed and unaddressed.</p>

        <p>In order to create a more cultivating experience, students were introduced to basic health concepts and were
            explained why different measurements were being taken. This allowed medical care to feel like something
            approachable rather than intimidating. One student shared, "The doctors told us what to do and gave us
            medicines. It was helpful, and it helped many of us." The simplicity of this response reflected the larger
            impact of the day—care that was clear, reassuring, and accessible.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>By integrating healthcare into schools, early concerns can be identified without disrupting routine or
            placing additional financial strain on families. CareForAll plans to continue expanding similar initiatives,
            strengthening partnerships with medical institutions and schools to reach more children who would benefit
            from preventive care.</p>

        <p>Sustainable change in child health relies on shared effort. Volunteering time, supporting school-based health
            programmes, and spreading awareness all play a role in ensuring that children grow with the care and
            attention they deserve.</p>
